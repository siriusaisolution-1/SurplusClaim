# Repository Agent Rules

## Scope
These rules apply to the entire repository.

## Workflow expectations
- Keep each change set small; aim for a maximum diff size of roughly 200 lines to ease review.
- Submit only one pull request per task.
- Always run linting, type-checking, testing, and build steps before completing a task.
- Do not disable automated checks globally.
- Do not modify secrets or secret-management configuration.
